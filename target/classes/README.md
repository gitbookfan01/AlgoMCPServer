# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems, written in **Java**.  
Every problem must follow the same conventions to keep the repo clean and consistent.

---

## ✅ Guidelines

### 1. Solution Requirements
- Implement solutions in **Java**.
- Each solution must include:
    - **Time complexity** (Big-O, stated in comments).
    - **Space complexity** (Big-O, stated in comments).
- Provide both a **naïve** and an **optimized** approach if applicable.
- Keep code **clean, well-structured, and documented**.

### 2. Unit Tests
- All solutions must have **JUnit 5** tests.
- Cover:
    - Normal cases
    - Edge cases
    - Large inputs (if reasonable)
- Use `assertArrayEquals` or `assertEquals` as appropriate.
